The following scripts have been inserted for testing:
readVals.sh		-->Perl script that reads values every second out of sensor_output.xml and writes them in the corresponding fil	es in ./TestData folder.
plotPDF.r		-->After all data has been written by above script this R script puts the raw data in some nice plots
startVermontStats.sh	-->Coordinates everything. Starts readVals.sh and vermont, stops readVals.sh after Vermont is finished, creates new directory with current dateTime in TestData and moves everything interesting there

Compact:
start everything by typing: sudo ./startVermontStats.sh myConfig and admire the stats in TestData/$dateTimeFolder$

Note:
if you are not replaying dumps but traffic you will have to kill Vermont sooner or later. Do this with signal 2...
